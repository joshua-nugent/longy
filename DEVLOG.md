# longy Development Log

## v0.1 — Completed 2026-02-12

### What was built

Full R package implementing IPW estimation for longitudinal causal inference. The package is installed at `longy/` and pushed to `github.com/joshua-nugent/longy` (private).

### Package contents

**14 R source files:**

**Simulated dataset:** `data/sim_longy.rda` — 2000 subjects, 10 time points, with known true causal effects stored as attribute `"true_effects"`. Generated by `data-raw/make_sim_longy.R`.

**Tests:** 146 tests across 10 test files in `tests/testthat/`, plus `helper-simulate.R` with 6 data generators (`simulate_test_data`, `simulate_no_confounding`, `simulate_no_censoring`, `simulate_always_observed`, `simulate_continuous_outcome`, `simulate_survival_outcome`).

**Docs:** All exported functions have roxygen2 documentation. 15 `.Rd` files in `man/`.

### Key design decisions

- **S3 classes** (not R6) for `longy_data`, `longy_result`, `longy_results`
- **data.table** internally via `@import data.table`; accepts data.frame at boundary
- **SuperLearner** optional (in Suggests); falls back to glm via `.safe_sl()`
- **Long format only** — one row per person-time
- **Three nuisance models** matching `ipw run.R`:
  - g_A: treatment propensity (risk set: consistent + uncensored through t-1)
  - g_C: censoring (risk set: above + treatment at t consistent with regime)
  - g_R: observation (risk set: above + uncensored at t — most restrictive)
- **Weight formula**: `final(t) = cumprod(sw_a * sw_c)[t] * sw_r(t)` — A×C cumulated, R point-in-time
- **Pipe-friendly**: each step returns modified `longy_data` object

### Verification results

- `devtools::check()`: **0 errors, 0 warnings**, 1 note (global variable binding — cosmetic)
- `devtools::test()`: **146/146 pass**
- End-to-end on `sim_longy`: runs both regimes, early time points track known truth

### Issues encountered and resolved

1. **data.table cedta() error in R CMD check**: Fixed by using `@import data.table` instead of individual `@importFrom`, and replacing `.()` with `list()` in data.table `[` calls.
2. **Non-ASCII characters**: Em-dashes in `estimate_ipw.R` caused WARNING. Replaced with `--`.
3. **Marginal fallback not bounded**: When all outcomes at a time point are the same value, the marginal mean (0 or 1) exceeded prediction bounds. Fixed by applying `.bound()` to marginal fallback too.
4. **IC SE = 0 when all outcomes identical**: Legitimate edge case. Test updated to allow SE=0 when estimate is 0 or 1.
5. **IC variance fix**: Centered IC (using `stats::var()`) for finite-sample robustness, following ltmle's HouseholdIC pattern.
6. **Sampling weights**: Added external sampling/survey weights support throughout pipeline (nuisance model fitting, marginal rates, final weight multiplication).
7. **Continuous outcome support**: Verified Hajek estimator + IC inference work unchanged for continuous Y. Added binary outcome validation (`Y in {0,1,NA}` when `outcome_type = "binary"`).
8. **Survival outcome + isotonic smoothing**: Added `stats::isoreg()` post-processing for survival outcomes to enforce monotone non-decreasing cumulative incidence. SEs from unsmoothed ICs, CIs recomputed around smoothed estimates.
9. **Better error messages**: Defensive `tryCatch` on dynamic/stochastic regime evaluation, always-warn on SuperLearner failure, GLM fallback tryCatch, non-finite weight warnings, empty-fits warnings, consistent "Use define_regime() first" messages, survey install suggestion.
10. **Plot method**: `plot.longy_result()` with ggplot2 (optional) or base R fallback.

## Next steps

### Short-term improvements to v0.1 (all complete)

1. ~~**Larger simulated dataset**~~ -- Done (n=2000).
2. ~~**SuperLearner integration testing**~~ -- Done (explicit SL test added).
3. ~~**Sandwich inference testing**~~ -- Done (explicit test + IC/sandwich agreement test).

### v0.2 — G-computation (Completed 2026-02-13)

**What was built:** G-computation estimator using direct outcome regression at each time point. This gives a second estimator that relies on correct outcome model specification instead of correct propensity score specification.

**New files:**
| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `R/fit_outcome.R` | `fit_outcome()` — outcome model E[Y_t \| covariates, A] at each time |
| `R/estimate_gcomp.R` | `estimate_gcomp()` — G-comp point estimates + bootstrap inference |

**Modified files:**
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `R/longy.R` | Added `estimator` param (`"ipw"`, `"gcomp"`, `"both"`); `n_boot=0` skips all inference |
| `R/inference.R` | Added `.bootstrap_gcomp_inference()`, `.run_bootstrap()` with `future.apply` parallel support |
| `R/estimate_ipw.R` | Updated print/summary/plot methods to handle G-comp label; `inference="none"` option |
| `R/longy-package.R` | Added new globalVariables for fit_outcome columns |
| `DESCRIPTION` | Added `future`, `future.apply` to Suggests |

**Algorithm:**
1. At each time t (backward loop, though order doesn't matter):
   - Risk set: ALL uncensored subjects through t (not regime-restricted)
   - Training subset: risk set AND Y_t non-missing (handles R=0 intermittent missingness)
   - Fit Y_t ~ baseline + timevarying + A using `.safe_sl()`
   - Predict counterfactually (set A to regime value) for all in risk set
2. Point estimate: mean(Q_hat(t)) at each requested time = E[Y_t(a)]
3. Inference: nonparametric bootstrap (resample subjects, refit, percentile CIs)
4. Isotonic smoothing for survival outcomes (same as IPW)

**Key design decisions:**
- **A included in covariates** — model learns E[Y | X, A], counterfactual prediction sets A = regime value
- **Broad risk set** — all uncensored subjects, not just regime-consistent. Lets model learn from treatment variation; counterfactual predictions handle the intervention
- **No backward pseudo-outcome propagation** — each time t fits Y_t directly. L_t mediates past treatment effects, so a correctly specified concurrent model gives E[Y_t(a)]. Backward ICE will be re-introduced for TMLE targeting
- **Known limitation**: without censoring adjustment, G-comp targets E[Y_t(a) | uncensored through t], not E[Y_t(a)] in the full population. TMLE/IPCW will address this
- Bootstrap-only inference for pure G-comp (no EIF/IC formula). DR-IC arrives with TMLE in v0.3
- No propensity models required — G-comp point estimates don't need g_A/g_C/g_R
- `estimator = "both"` appends `_ipw` / `_gcomp` suffixes to regime names
- Parallel bootstrap via `future.apply` when a non-sequential `future::plan()` is active

**Verification:**
- `devtools::check()`: **0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes**
- `devtools::test()`: **196/196 pass** (146 existing + 50 new G-comp tests)
- Truth-recovery test: continuous outcome G-comp matches E[Y_t(a)] = 0.3a + 0.05t within 0.05 at each time (no-censoring DGP)
- Binary, continuous, survival outcomes all work end-to-end
- Monotone cumulative incidence enforced for survival via isotonic smoothing
- `longy(estimator = "gcomp")` and `longy(estimator = "both")` work end-to-end
- Parallel bootstrap tested with `future::multisession`

### v0.3 — TMLE + cross-fitting

- Doubly-robust TMLE combining IPW + G-comp
- Activate cross-fitting in `crossfit.R` — sample-split nuisance estimation
- `set_crossfit()` already assigns folds; need to loop fits over folds
- New file: `R/estimate_tmle.R`

**Design note — G-comp censoring adjustment (2026-02-13):**
Current G-comp targets E[Y_t(a) | uncensored through t], not E[Y_t(a)] in the full population, because it fits only on uncensored subjects without IPCW weighting. Two approaches were considered:
- **(a) IPCW-weighted outcome regression** (stremr approach): weight the outcome model by cumulative inverse censoring probability. Makes standalone G-comp correct under informative censoring but requires g_C models, breaking the "no propensity needed" simplicity.
- **(b) Let TMLE handle it** (lmtp approach): leave G-comp as restriction-only; the TMLE fluctuation step corrects for censoring bias via the clever covariate.
Decision: go with (b) for now. Revisit adding optional IPCW weights to `fit_outcome()` later if users need a censoring-adjusted G-comp without full TMLE.

### v0.4+ — Extensions

- Stochastic interventions (regime infrastructure already supports this)
- Continuous treatments
- Competing risks
- Marginal structural models (smoothing across time)
- Optional IPCW-weighted G-comp (revisit from v0.3 design note)
- ffSL-style parallel SuperLearner (port from user's `ffSL.R`)

### Code quality

- Add `pkgdown` site
- Add CI via GitHub Actions (`R-CMD-check.yaml`)
- Consider `lintr` / `styler` for consistent formatting
- Vignette: "Getting started with longy"
