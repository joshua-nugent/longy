Description: Estimates causal effects in longitudinal settings with
    time-varying treatments, confounders, informative censoring, and
    intermittent outcome measurement. Implements inverse probability
    weighting (IPW) with stabilized weights, influence-curve-based
    inference, and weight diagnostics. Designed for long-format
    (one row per person-time) data with a pipe-friendly modular API.
