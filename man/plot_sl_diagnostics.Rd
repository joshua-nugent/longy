\usage{
plot_sl_diagnostics(
  obj,
  regime = NULL,
  model = "all",
  type = c("weights", "risk", "heatmap", "method"),
  drop_zero = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A \code{longy_data} object, or a data.table from
\code{sl_diagnostics()}.}

\item{regime}{Character. Regime name (passed to \code{sl_diagnostics()} if
\code{obj} is a \code{longy_data}).}

\item{model}{Character. Which model(s) to include: \code{"all"} (default),
\code{"treatment"}, \code{"censoring"}, \code{"observation"}, or
\code{"outcome"}.}

\item{type}{Character. Plot type:
\describe{
\item{\code{"weights"}}{Stacked bar chart of ensemble weights by time,
faceted by nuisance model. Shows which learners dominate and how the
ensemble composition changes over time.}
\item{\code{"risk"}}{Per-learner CV risk across time, faceted by nuisance
model. Highlights where model fit degrades.}
\item{\code{"heatmap"}}{Heatmap of learner weights (time x learner),
faceted by nuisance model. Scales better than stacked bars with many
learners or time points.}
\item{\code{"method"}}{Tile plot showing which fitting method
(SuperLearner, glm, marginal) was used at each time point.}
}}

\item{drop_zero}{Logical. If TRUE (default), omit learners with zero weight
from weight-based plots (\code{"weights"} and \code{"heatmap"}).}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object, or NULL invisibly if there is nothing to plot.
}
\description{
Visualizes SuperLearner fit information across time points and nuisance
models. Requires ggplot2.
