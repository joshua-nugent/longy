\title{Prediction Diagnostics}
\usage{
prediction_diagnostics(obj, regime = NULL, model = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A \code{longy_data} object with at least one nuisance model fit.}

\item{regime}{Character. Name of the regime. If NULL, uses the first
available regime.}

\item{model}{Character. Which model(s) to include: \code{"all"} (default),
\code{"treatment"}, \code{"censoring"}, or \code{"observation"}.}
}
\value{
A data.table with columns: \code{model}, \code{time}, \code{n_risk},
\code{marginal}, \code{min}, \code{p05}, \code{median}, \code{mean},
\code{p95}, \code{max}.
}
\description{
Summarizes the distribution of predicted probabilities from each fitted
nuisance model (treatment, censoring, observation) by time point. Useful
for spotting near-positivity violations and understanding which models are
driving extreme weights.
