\title{longy: Longitudinal Causal Inference via IPW, G-Computation, and TMLE}
\description{
Estimates causal effects in longitudinal settings with time-varying treatments, confounders, informative censoring, and intermittent outcome measurement. Implements inverse probability weighting (IPW) with stabilized weights, influence-curve-based inference, and weight diagnostics. Designed for long-format (one row per person-time) data with a pipe-friendly modular API.
