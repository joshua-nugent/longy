\usage{
plot_influence_diagnostics(
  x,
  type = c("scatter", "quintile", "density", "cumulative"),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{longy_influence_diag} object from
\code{influence_diagnostics()}.}

\item{type}{Character. Plot type:
\describe{
\item{\code{"scatter"}}{Weight vs outcome scatter with loess smooth,
faceted by time. Shows the correlation driving the difference.}
\item{\code{"quintile"}}{Bar chart of mean outcome by weight quintile.
Shows subgroup patterns driving the IPW estimate.}
\item{\code{"density"}}{Overlaid densities of observed Y vs G-comp
counterfactual predictions Q_hat. Shows distributional shift.}
\item{\code{"cumulative"}}{Cumulative contribution plot. Subjects sorted
by absolute influence; shows how concentrated the estimate is.}
}}

\item{...}{Unused.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object.
}
\description{
Multi-panel plot showing the relationship between weights, outcomes, and
counterfactual predictions. Helps diagnose why adjusted estimates differ
from unadjusted means.
