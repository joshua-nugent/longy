\title{Simulated Longitudinal Dataset with Known Causal Effects}
\format{
A data.frame with the following columns:
\describe{
\item{id}{Subject identifier (integer 1-2000)}
\item{time}{Time point (integer 0-9)}
\item{W1}{Baseline covariate, continuous (N(0,1))}
\item{W2}{Baseline covariate, binary (Bernoulli(0.3))}
\item{L1}{Time-varying confounder, continuous (affected by past treatment)}
\item{L2}{Time-varying confounder, binary}
\item{A}{Treatment indicator (binary, 0/1)}
\item{C}{Censoring indicator (binary, 1 = censored, absorbing)}
\item{R}{Outcome observation indicator (binary, 1 = observed, intermittent)}
\item{Y}{Outcome (binary, observed only when R=1 and C=0)}
}

The dataset has an attribute \code{"true_effects"} containing a data.frame with
columns \code{time}, \code{EY1} (expected outcome under always-treat), and
\code{EY0} (expected outcome under never-treat) computed by
large-sample Monte Carlo simulation under the known DGP.

\description{
A simulated dataset of 2000 subjects observed over 10 time points, with
time-varying confounders, informative censoring, intermittent outcome
measurement, and known true causal effects for validation.
