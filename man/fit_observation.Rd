\item{adaptive_cv}{Logical. Adaptive CV fold selection.}

\item{min_obs}{Integer. Minimum observations for model fitting.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Progress messages.}
}
\value{
Modified \code{longy_data} object with observation fits stored.

\description{
Models P(R(t) = 1 | past) — the probability that the outcome is measured at
time t. This handles intermittent missingness, which is distinct from
absorbing censoring.
}
\details{
The risk set is the most restrictive: regime-consistent through t,
uncensored through t, and treatment at t consistent with regime.
