\title{Compute Inverse Probability Weights}
\usage{
compute_weights(
  obj,
  regime = NULL,
  stabilized = TRUE,
  truncation = NULL,
  truncation_quantile = NULL,
  g_bounds = c(0.01, 1)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A \code{longy_data} object with treatment (and optionally censoring/observation)
models already fit.}

\item{regime}{Character. Name of the regime.}

\item{stabilized}{Logical. Use stabilized weights (numerator = marginal probability).}

\item{truncation}{Numeric. Hard upper bound for weights. NULL for no truncation.}

\item{truncation_quantile}{Numeric in (0,1). Truncate at this quantile.
Applied after \code{truncation} if both specified.}

\item{g_bounds}{Numeric vector of length 2. Bounds for cumulative g
(denominator). Default \code{c(0.01, 1)}. Stored for use by TMLE.}
}
\value{
Modified \code{longy_data} object with weights stored.
}
\description{
Combines treatment, censoring, and observation model predictions into
stabilized inverse probability weights. Treatment and censoring weights
are cumulated (absorbing processes); observation weights are point-in-time
(intermittent process).
